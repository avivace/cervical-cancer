abstract = {Repeated measurements of smoking, cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) status and sexual behaviour were used to measure the risk of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in relation to changes in smoking and cervical HPV status, and to explore the impact of smoking on the acquisition and duration of incident cervical HPV infection. Included in this longitudinal analysis are 1485 women aged 15-19 years: 1075 were HPV-negative and cytologically normal at recruitment; 410 were HPV-positive, cytologically abnormal or both, at this time. Women re-attended every 6 months, when samples were taken for cytological and virological examination. Current smoking intensity was associated with an increased risk of high-grade CIN, after controlling for cervical HPV status (compared to non-smokers, hazards ratio (HR) for 10 or more cigarettes per day = 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-4.12, p-trend = 0.008). In women who were HPV-negative and cytologically normal at recruitment, current smoking was not significantly associated with the risk of acquiring a cervical HPV infection, after controlling for life-time number of partners and age of oldest partner (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.90-1.41); nor did it prolong the length of time during which HPV could be detected (HR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.78-1.34). Current smoking intensity is an independent risk factor for high-grade CIN in young women, after controlling for cervical HPV infection. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Early age at first sexual intercourse (AFSI) has long been associated with an increased risk of invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC). Age at first pregnancy (AFP) and ICC have been investigated less, although AFSI and AFP are strongly interrelated in most developing countries. A pooled analysis of case-control studies on ICC from eight developing countries with 1864 cases and 1719 controls investigated the roles of AFSI, AFP, and ICC risk. Age at first sexual intercourse, AFP and age at first marriage (AFM) were highly interrelated and had similar ICC risk estimates. Compared with women with AFSI 21 years, the odds ratio (OR) of ICC was 1.80 (95% CI: 1.50-2.39) among women with AFSI 17-20 years and 2.31 (95% CI: 1.85-2.87) for AFSI 16 years (P-trend 0.001). No statistical interaction was detected between AFSI and any established risk factors for ICC. The ICC risk was 2.4-fold among those who reported AFSI and AFP at 16 years compared with those with AFSI and AFP at 21 years. These data confirm AFSI and AFB as risk factors for ICC in eight developing countries, but any independent effects of these two events could not be distinguished. {\textcopyright} 2009 Cancer Research UK.

@misc{Bosch2002,
abstract = {During the 1990s, epidemiological studies, supported by molecular technology, provided evidence on the causal role of some human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in the development of cervical cancer. This association has been evaluated under all proposed sets of causality criteria and endorsed by the scientific community and major review institutes. The finding is universally consistent, and to date there are no documented alternative hypotheses for the aetiology of cervical cancer. HPV has been proposed as the first ever identified, "necessary cause" of a human cancer. In practical terms, the concept of a necessary cause implies that cervical cancer does not and will not develop in the absence of the persistent presence of HPV DNA. Cervical cancer is still the second most common cancer in women worldwide, although it is a theoretically preventable disease. In developed parts of the world, and in populations where cytology based programmes are established, it would be beneficial to add HPV testing to the screening protocol. HPV testing was shown by several studies, including one randomised trial, to be of help in solving the ambiguous cases generated by cytology reading. In populations where cytology programmes are either not in place or are not efficient, HPV testing should now be considered and evaluated as an alternative test for primary screening. Prevention of exposure to high risk HPV types by vaccination may prove to be the most efficient and logistically feasible preventive intervention for cervical cancer. At this stage of development, regulatory agencies are requested to evaluate the scientific evidence and weigh its implications in relation to costs, public health investments, and policy. This is a subjective evaluation that could be guided by a careful description of the most relevant studies and findings.},

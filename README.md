# Cervical Cancer exploratory study

Final project for the *Data and Text Mining* course, master in Computer Science. [KNIME workflow](https://github.com/avivace/cervical-cancer/blob/master/cervix.knwf), [Report PDF](https://github.com/avivace/cervical-cancer/blob/master/report.pdf).

Cervical Cancer is one of the most treatable
cancers when diagnosed at early stages. Yet, **it killed
311000 women in 2018 and it’s still the fourth cause of
death from cancers in women**, the second most common
in developing areas, mainly because of the economic cost
and the difficulties in implementing effectives screening
programmes. Data Mining provides robust tools to verify
the known causal relations and assess risk factors from
medical datasets. **Classification models and clustering can then exploit
this scenario to help identifying groups of population at
higer risk to improve planning of screening programmes.**

This year in the US, there will be an estimated
13800 new cases of Cervical cancer. 4290 will be
deadly. Worldwide, this type of cancer causes
makes up 8% of the total cancer cases and deaths.
It’s the fourth (second in developing countries)
cause of death from cancer in women. A lot of
progress has been made, and nowadays it is one of
the most curable: when diagnosed and treated at the
earliest stages, the five-year survival rate can reach
95%.

In this work, we investigate the possibility of
classifying high-risk patients from demographic and
other medical data, but excluding the results of the other
related exams.

**Known causal relations**: HPV causal relation
with the cervical cancer has been documented be-
yond reasonable doubt. Additionally, the *Human
papilloma virus* infection is necessary for the development 
of *CIN*, the abnormal growth of cells
on the surface of the cervix, indicating a potentially
precancerous transformation of cells of the cervix.
Risk factors include smoking, early age at the
first sexual intercourse and early pregnancies.
